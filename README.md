# calculator-v2-react-study

This project was created in React after the completion of the Udemy course, [JavaScript Web Project: 20 Projects to Build Your Portfolio](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-web-projects-to-build-your-portfolio-resume/).

During this course, the project was made with vanilla JavaScript so I rewrote the entire app in React. The vanilla JavaScript version: [calculator-v1-javascript-study](https://github.com/Pyon18Pyon/calculator-v1-javascript-study).
